    "### Complexity Control, revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that one of the most important fundamental principles underlying data science, the basis for machine learning, is *complexity control*.  We must manage the tension between allowing ourselves to fit complex patterns in the data (a good thing), and the tendency to fit idiosyncracies in a particular data set--things that do not generalize (a bad thing).  So we attempt to control complexity.  One way to control complexity is just not to allow our data mining procedure to fit complex models in the first place.  That's what we do when we build linear models from small sets of features.  But let's consider the case where we think larger feature sets or non-linearities might add important predictive power--so we will attempt to control complexity in a data-driven fashion.\n",

This is achieved by adding a \"penalty term\" into the objective function, and using a \"regularization parameter\" $\\lambda$ (also sometimes represented as `c`, which is usually $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ so smaller values of `c` lead to larger complexity penalties) to specify how much importance our optimization procedure should place on the fit vs. the penalty:\n",
